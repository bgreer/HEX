Documentation:
    
    This library will take readings from a Devantech Tpa-81 Thermopile, and 
advanced I2C sensor. 
    The constructor to create a Tpa81 object is: Tpa81(deviceID), where the
deviceID is the address offset, default of 0;
    To get a reading, call getData(char[8] pixels) on your Tpa81 object. This 
will return an integer value for the ambient temperature, and will fill pixels
with the 8 individual readings
    See the examples sketches
